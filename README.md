### Background 
Implicit bias describes how individuals hold certain attitudes and understandings that unconsciously affect their actions, decisions, and behavior (Staats, 2016). These often result in prejudice and negative treatment towards minorities. Implicit bias is prevalent in the criminal justice system, education, and workplace and as a result, minorities are often negatively affected. In one study, equally qualified resumes were sent to job postings and those with traditionally white names were 50% more likely to receive a callback than those with traditionally black names (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003). This one study alone suggests implicit bias plays a bigger role than we expect in society. 
Project Implicit was created in 1998 by researchers Dr. Tony Greenwald (University of Washington), Dr. Mahzarin Banaji (Harvard University), and Dr. Brian Nosek (University of Virginia) (About Us, n.d.). The focus of the Project Implicit is different tests that individuals take which generate a score revealing the person’s implicit bias level towards a specific demographic. The tests track a person’s response time to associations of groups of people and positive or negative words or images. For example harmful objects and black people and harmless objects and white people and vice versa. If someone more quickly associates harmless objects with white people than with black people they may hold bias against black people. The tests’ validity has been proven and supported by outside experiments that concluded the consistency and usefulness of the implicit association tests (Greenwald et al., n.d.). 

### Purpose
This study will look at different demographics’ implicit bias levels. Since implicit bias has a large presence in society, affecting many social systems, it is important to look at its root and where to apply the strategies for limiting bias. With more knowledge on which type of implicit bias is strongest or most prevalent when and who is likely to have low implicit bias levels, preventative measures can be more focused.

### Data 
The data for this project comes from Project Implicit's implicit association tests. The data sets were downloaded from their website. Link: https://osf.io/y9hiq/

### Code 
All code is in R. 

### File Navigation
In the code folder, there are the following files that contain all of the code and tests used in the study:

401_skintone.rmd - analysis for skin tone-based bias and LASSO regression visual 

401_gender.rmd - analysis for gender-based bias

401_sexuality.rmd - analysis for sexuality-based bias

401_weight.rmd - analysis for weight-based bias

401_exploritory.rmd - all visuals and summary statistics gathered in the data exploration phase
